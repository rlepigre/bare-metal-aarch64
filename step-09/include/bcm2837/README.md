BCM2837 SoC
===========

No documentation for the BCM2837 peripheral interface is available (it seems).
However, according to the Raspberry Pi documentation webpage, the architecture
of the BCM2837 is essentially identical to the BCM2835, whose documentation is
available. We thus rely on the BCM2835 peripheral specification document.

Some useful links:

- [Peripheral documentation for the BCM2835](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/bcm2835/bcm2835-peripherals.pdf)
- [Peripheral documentation for the BCM2837 (unofficial, based on the above)](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues/325#issuecomment-379651504)
